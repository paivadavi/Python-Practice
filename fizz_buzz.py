#Problem description
#Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:
#
#    if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number
#    if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number
#    for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
#    print the rest of the numbers unchanged.
#
#Important: This problem was proposed to me as a challenge during my studies in JetBrains Academy


for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 != 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif i % 3 != 0 and i % 5 != 0:
        print(i)
